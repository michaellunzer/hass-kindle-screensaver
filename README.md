# Home Assistant Kindle Screensaver
 
 This tool can be used to display a over view of your Home Assistant instance on e.g. a [jailbroken](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=236104) Kindle device.
 
 It currently shows the current temperature and renders the history of the last 24hrs and the forecast of a weather component in a graph.
 
 Every minute, an image is generated from a website which is rendered by react. This image is converted into a format, which the Kindle e-ink screens can display. The device can then download the device and display it.
